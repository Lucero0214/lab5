00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:05,193

00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:10,440
- [Narrator] Divinity: Original Sin.

6
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:13,120
- [Speaker 2] Them gulls,
means we're close to shore.

7
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,480
(waves crashing)
I don't envy ya going there,

8
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,340
Master (indistinct).
- New kid,

9
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:18,900
we wanna thank you for
helping us determine

10
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:20,820
whether or not Monica
was a two-faced bitch.

11
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,107
She really made us mad,

12
00:00:22,107 --> 00:00:23,940
but it turns out she
couldn't have been the one

13
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:25,200
spreading rumors about Allie Nelson

14
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,580
going to the abortion clinic.
- Yeah!

15
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:28,330
- To solve this before
something else happens.

16
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:29,940

00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:32,337
- [Speaker 3] This is bigger
than what I thought it was.

18
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,680
And I didn't see it, didn't see...

19
00:00:37,127 --> 00:00:38,790
- [Speaker 4] (indistinct) erosion.

20
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:39,701

00:00:40,953 --> 00:00:42,360

26
00:00:48,533 --> 00:00:51,150

28
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:59,610
- [Narrator] And the winner is

29
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:02,070
South Park: The Stick of Truth,

30
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:04,350
written by Matt and Trey, themselves,

31
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:06,210
South Park: The Stick of Truth

32
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:08,430
was probably one of the best transitions

33
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:11,880
from televised series to
video game we've seen yet.

34
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,580
There's been a small
handful of South Park games

35
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:17,850
in the past that the duo just
passed off to the developers,

36
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:19,650
and the quality showed.

37
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:22,290
This time, however, things were different.

38
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:24,300
Working hands-on with the developers,

39
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:26,700
Matt Stone and Trey
Parker wrote the script

40
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,710
to probably the most crass

41
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:31,350
and hilarious game this year.

42
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:33,990
Stick of Truth went
directions many developers

43
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:35,490
are afraid to take,

44
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:40,003
and the result paid off.
