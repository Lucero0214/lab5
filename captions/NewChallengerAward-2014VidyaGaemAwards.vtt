00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:02.120
Yacht

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:07.190
Club games managed to capture lightning in
a bottle with the release of Shovel Knight.

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:12.700
When so many developers fail to emulate the
style and substance that made those NES classics

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:17.890
so great, Shovel Knight feels and looks like
it was ripped straight out of the 90’s.

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.710
From the start menu to the ending credits,
Shovel Knight dazzles with a graphics style

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.910
that matches the best from a bygone era and
controls that would make Miyamoto blush.

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:30.820
Shovel Knight has it all.

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:37.450
Prophetic goatmen, dancing fish royalty, platforming
that demands a deft touch and boss fights

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.230
that will have you wanting to snap your 3DS
in half.

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:46.630
Shovel Knight was an absolute breath of fresh
air into the decrepit lungs of the 2D platforming

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:47.630
genre.

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.990
Whatever you do yacht club games, don’t
disappoint us when you release the inevitable

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.990
sequel.

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:59.640
For now, rejoice as the masses have chosen
Shovel Knight as the winner for best new IP.
