- [Announcer] New Challenger Award for best new IP: D4, Shovel Knight, The Evil Within, ♪ But I won't save you ♪ Transistor, Freedom Wars, And the winner is Shovel Knight. Yacht Club Games managed to capture lightning in a bottle with the release of Shovel Knight. When so many developers failed to emulate the style and substance that made those NES classics so great, Shovel Knight feels and looks like it was ripped straight out of the '90s. From the start menu to the ending credits, Shovel Knight dazzles with a graphic style that matches the best from a bygone era, and controls that would make Miyamoto blush. Shovel Knight has it all. Prophetic goat men, dancing fish royalty, platforming that demands a deft touch, and boss fights that will have you wanting to snap your 3DS in half. Shovel Knight was an absolute breath of fresh air into the decrepit lungs of the 2D platforming genre. Whatever you do, Yacht Club Games, don't disappoint us when you release the inevitable sequel. For now, rejoice as the masses have chosen Shovel Knight as the winner for Best New IP.
